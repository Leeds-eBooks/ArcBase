For Meister, the former philosophy student, thinking and writing were the same, and in this poetry the reader is able to follow through the poet's thought-processes, triggered by the everyday and rooted in the peculiarities of words. Often the conclusions are uncomfortable: life inevitably suggests death, love the end of love, security the loss of freedom and these are consequences the poems do not allow us to escape.This volume collects representative poems, the vast majority never before available in English, written throughout the poet's life. In this compelling new translation, the reader may accompany him not just into the mindset of individual poems but also through a series of poetic wrestlings with life to a final confrontation with approaching death which very few poets have attempted with such clarity.Yet there is nothing morbid or depressing about these poems: Meister's answer to Nietzsche's comment that life is lived between nothing and nothing is a simple one: love. If the poet's conclusions are unflinching they are also, in the end, both startling and uplifting.","collectors":"","contact":[""],"height":"

Because he came to poetry relatively late (he was 38 when his first collection was published), he was able to draw on a body of experience which was not available to younger poets. Like Hardy, a poet whom he greatly admired, he wrote simply, from a sense of his own life, using detailed observation of personal encounters and situations to convey the wider, more general picture.Rich in metaphor and imagery, Ferraterï¿½s remarkable poetry is presented in this volume in an equally remarkable translation by Arthur Terry whose affinity with the poet is not only declared in his translatorï¿½s preface but is also self-evident from the powerful poetic ï¿½voiceï¿½ he creates in English. Terry started to translate Ferrater whilst Professor of Spanish at Queenï¿½s University, Belfast in the 1960s: ï¿½by happy coincidence, these were the early years of the Belfast Writing Group [which] included a number of excellent poets and criticsï¿½ whose presence first encouraged me to translate seriously.ï¿½ A member of this group, Seamus Heaney, came under the spell of both Ferrater and Terry and his introduction to this volume is as illuminating to the new reader of Ferrater and as full of insight as Terryï¿½s undoubtedly was for those young writers more than forty years ago.","collectors":"","contact":[""],"height":"138 mm","language":"Catalan / English","pages":"98","price":[{"type":"pbk","value":"8.95"},{"type":"hbk","value":"11.95"},{"type":"ebk","value":"4.49"}],"pubdate":"2004-07-01","quotes":"ï¿½Like Wordsworth, Ferrater endeavours to keep his reader in the presence of flesh and bloodï¿½ [He] not only brings us to our senses, but like all true poets, he keeps us wondering what this means.ï¿½Seamus Heaney","review_copies":"AcumenAgendaAmbitEnvoiGuardian (Lit Ed)Independent on Sunday IndependentIsrael Book ReviewLondon MagMPTNorth, TheOrbisOrient ExpressPN ReviewPoetry LondonPoetry ReviewPoetry WalesPQRPrague Lit ReviewRoundyhouseTranslation IrelandTranslation & Lit (Glasgow)WeyfarersWord Hoard, The","rights":"","roleMap":[{"id":"56b1f2356d122cf36f00e72b","roles":{"author":true,"editor":false,"introducer":false,"translator":false}}],"sample_poem":"FloralThat spring of nineteen fifty-two, the girlsall wore white blouses and green cardigans,and in the streets we heard the sudden rustlingof flowers and leaves in which there lay concealedthe dark rind of the almond trees.

Her characters are isolated as individuals, many of them by virtue of their Muslim culture; all live at a slant to the world around them, prisoners in one way or another of a great silence. Maram al-Masri has donated her voice here, in Arabic and French, to breaking that silence. The translations are by the Irish poet Theo Dorgan.","longdesc":"Maram al-Masri here gives voice and presence to women, and some young boys, who are in one way or another mysterious to us — not just because they are ‘other’ but because they mainly live in a cultural community whose codes and conventions are opaque to Europeans.

The poet seems to be telling us nothing we suffer is beyond our humanity, and our pleasures only increase the stock. Itï¿½s extremely unusual to recognise an actual individual in his / her poetry, but not only does Julia Darling accomplish this, I think she manages an even more unlikely feat: she makes her experiences knowable to us as an ordinary part of life.

English-language poet and a major literary voice from Asia.ï¿½Carlo CoppolaThis distinctive and memorable volume of selected poems by Alamgir Hashmi draws on seven original books of his poetry published since 1976, and represents the most comprehensive selection of his work to appear in the UK to date.Lyrical, compassionate and personal on the one hand, ironical, political and wryly humorous on the other, these poems take us to America and Europe as well as through the rich, vibrant countryside and cities of Pakistan. Love poems and poems about family and domestic life are juxtaposed with acerbic comment on oppressive regimes, in Pakistan and elsewhere, and shining through everything is an understated wisdom and erudition, and a vivid evocation of the natural world.The late Ted Hughes described Hashmiï¿½s poems as ï¿½a delight ï¿½ sinuous and assured, serious with a light touch, full of character, surprise, authenticity.ï¿½ This is poetry which looks both to the East and the West and in so doing, establishes its unique position in English-language poetry ï¿½ unusual, beautiful and enduring.","collectors":"","contact":[""],"height":" 216","language":"Pakistan","pages":"96 pp","price":[{"type":"pbk","value":"8.95"},{"type":"hbk","value":"11.95"},{"type":"ebk","value":"4.49"}],"pubdate":"","quotes":"","review_copies":"","rights":"","sample_poem":"The Ramazan LibationAgainst the orange skyour cornice-crows lifttheir wings.The grass can sleep.Steadfast faith scudsto the mosque on two legs;piety belchesa fast or twoand prayers whirl like ghostsin urban wind.Your awry visions may fly upbut no stars will break.(Hush Devil).The grass can sleep.","series":"International","series_num":"","shortdesc":"","title":"Ramazan Libation, The: Selected Poems","toc":"ntroduction / 9from The Oath and Amen: Love PoemsGhazal / 15from America Is a Punjabi WordAmerica is a Punjabi Word / 19 1 I was in NewYork / 212 Might I be helped?

anthology breaks new ground in the English-speaking world by publishing translations of poems by Polish writers all under the age of forty-five. It reflects the range of different writing practices that have flourished in various parts of Poland over the last fifteen years, and tries to achieve a balance between them.Practically all the work in this selection was written in the post-communist period, but in cultural historical terms it reflects the evolution of a sensibility that began to emerge in the mid-1980s, when Polish poetry was being realigned contentiously with newly visible traditions of European and American writing.This volume has been edited by three distinguished literary figures: Rod Mengham, poet, publisher and Reader in Modern English at Jesus College, Cambridge; Tadeusz Piï¿½ro, poet, translator, co-editor of the magazine Dwukropek and lecturer in American Literature at the University of Warsaw; and Piotr Szymor, a freelance translator living in Warsaw, and co-founder of the international artistsï¿½ association fabs.

In this place where I fellBy the wayside. And now it is carrying on.So I canï¿½t help that there isnï¿½t a placeYou could hide from me.As if we owned all theChimneys and forests. As if somewhere we went up in smokeLetting greenery enter the pastures.Earlier on, the fringed mould of snow blew upNot over a mine or some other kind of bombBut rather our dark, dark bodiesWhich anchored the snow. Stirring some memory perhaps.Unless itï¿½s exactly the opposite.And a bald patch on the head blew up.Tuned in to the humming. Thinned out by a blastCut away from the air over the station.In the end, the arguments underground took wing.There was the crying of planted seeds that wouldnï¿½t sprout.a spoonIï¿½d never actually been on earth.but came here straight after the summit.the rain is spattering like mad in drainpipes.or could it be borscht seething in restaurants for hours on end?time makes its entrance like a champion.but yields to persuasion.Iï¿½m all beat up like a dogor a man.and werenï¿½t we rushing out to meet the peoplewe should love. We were going to spring the birds from their cagethen bark happily in the sun.but you see. Man still canï¿½tbring himself to love whatever he should.I wish the rain would fall and wipe this sentence out.all parts of the nightthere was light under the bar. under the floorthe moonï¿½s forehead was sticking to the body.the dead dogï¿½s eyes were appalled.only the dog would not give up but was a passer-by.all this in the dark.the maggot of dawn hadnï¿½t started to squirm.it was hollow and caved in. non-operational.a crooked vein under the skin was moving deftly.shapes and bits of paper would disappear.memory blur.ice melting outside the window would deny the body.up and down the crossif I could only see: the upheaving earth.like a tangled head of hair. seethrough it from a great height. seeits ripples movingfrom west to west.I go up the cross sometimes I godown. nearly always slipping. somehowavoiding the wounds that have bedded down like molars.because you see the look turns the head when itï¿½sscared or run to earth.if I could only touch: the flood waters of rivers.clouding over everywhere like milk.over upheaving earth:who is hiding from us there?when theyï¿½ve been certain of arriving.consubstantial with the cross they will eat their fill. Let the games begin.a bone of contentionIï¿½d like to put my feet closer yetto the ground. Get snared in it like the deadin roots. or birds in their affidavits.and let the obese stars take a turn round the corner.let them jump onto a blue tablecloth.let my body get caught in my throat.for however does one live without being hated?my body must be brave in love as in cursing.may it turn into a bone of contention and storm.may it die out slowly like rare bird species.I used to be warm as a tree. not muchyounger than the world. created on the sixth day.with sunset already over.on the seventh at dawn the birds start waking up.to their accusations.if I were a weight on the scalesI wouldnï¿½t sink to the bottom.Iï¿½d throw nets sagging with fishand fish-heads over the bridges.keeping nothing for myself except this eclipse.scrumpingstraight into the wall. at 125 mph.this will be the pole star. maybe a collision.pink skin will be ground up like spilled crystals.and one scrap of cloth will dance like a butterfly.a bright glow will hang overhead.a luminosity too much for us to bear.if it fades we should run straight aheadcreating angels in the wall like me.you are my see-through background.which Iï¿½ll hit as the pupil is hit by citiesalight. when joy dies no one givesthe family black flowers. the pupil open asa gate is unfeeling as a button.itï¿½s been a hard day.

Wioletta Greg has published several volumes of poetry, a collection of short prose poems and, most recently, a debut novel, Guguly (Wydawnictwo Czarne, 2014), which has already been hailed as the 'discovery of the year' by critics and readers alike. Marek Kazmierski's attentive and nuanced translation of this, her first book-length publication in the UK, gives readers of English a chance to experience this powerful work for the first time.","pages":"128","price":[{"type":"pbk","value":"9.99"},{"type":"hbk","value":"12.99"},{"type":"ebk","value":"4.99"}],"pubdate":"2014-10-01","roleMap":[{"id":"56b1f235add19aff3701fa3c","roles":{"author":true,"editor":false,"introducer":false,"translator":false}},{"id":"56b1f235ba8593c46400be3f","roles":{"author":false,"editor":false,"introducer":false,"translator":true}}],"shortdesc":"One hundred years since the outbreak of the First World War, Wioletta Greg traces the seams of a family history through a century of life, death, love and tragedy with passion and humour.

seems as if the catAppeared from the slabs beneath our feet.The strata colours of its fur are the sameAs that of mossy gravestones.I try to ignore her as she rubsHer back against my legs. You kneelAnd stroke her head. She follows usInto the church. You sit on a ledgeIn the sun, perfect and unassuming.I construct the absent roof and wallsOf the church with blue slatesAnd boulders of sunlight. We findStillness and tranquility in ourselves.Around us there is loud chatterBy blackbirds, thrushes, magpies and common birdsThey leap through clear walls of light.The cat accompanies us to Sylvia's grave.It's an old Jewish tradition to bring a stoneFor the dead; and an Islamic oneTo bring some soil, as a mark of respect,I tell you as I crumble some earthAnd place a pebble on her grave.No other words come to mind. There is onlyThe hurt of strong sunlight and the shockOf all these weeds.

a time when western culture generates most of its symbols through the distortions of television, Mila Haugovï¿½ retains the remarkable ability to sing of the symbolic heights and depths of experience. Bold, iconic and revelatory, these translations do great services to the poems of a major Central European writer.ï¿½Andy BrownThis first UK publication for Slovakiaï¿½s leading woman poet concentrates on poetry written in the 1990s ï¿½ perhaps Haugovï¿½ï¿½s most fruitful period ï¿½ poetry which moves decisively from the anecdotal mainstream to a poetry which partakes of what D.H. Lawrence termed the ï¿½quickï¿½ of being.Feminism and ancient myth have contributed to the fabric of Haugovï¿½ï¿½s work as have the Central European traditions of surrealism and hermeticism. However, the recurrence of motifs and symbols creates a pattern of meaning which is readily accessible to readers prepared to respond to the poems with all their senses and emotions as well as the rational part of their being.Haugovï¿½ offers a poetry which continually reaches beyond itself, taking us into what might be unseen at the start of a poem but which is palpably evident once the poem has penetrated the pores of our skin.","collectors":"","contact":[""],"height":" 216","language":"Slovakian","pages":"138","price":[{"type":"pbk","value":"8.95"},{"type":"hbk","value":"11.95"},{"type":"ebk","value":"4.49"}],"pubdate":"","quotes":"","review_copies":"","rights":"","sample_poem":"DOUBLENESSTo want without wanting.I lack a semi-permeable membrane.In darkness a flowing unknowing resistance to rhythm.Horses approaching the menacing corral.In the evening they fall silent and become immersed in themselves, they strip for the night.The bodies of women swaying between two waters.A girl dives into a woman forever.Closed within the partly darkened place.Yesterdayï¿½s light retains a warm brightness there.The discharge in the cathode tube from certain circumstances certain.Sound here changes to colour there.It is similar to a word with the name of an angel.Unanchored in my senses I destroy.

shops press in on both sides of the roads, and the signboards, and the name-plates of businesses and offices. ï¿½No room for me in all this,ï¿½ said Angela. She was a badly-dressed girl and alone in the world. Just enough in her bag to buy the newspaper for the jobs page. When she was little she used to settle herself in the furthest room, a windowless room, under the table, lit by a candle placed on a chair close by, at her own height, and there play imaginary games all afternoon. Only the squeaking of a mouse kept her company in her game. But since then, not even that refuge. Since then, the street, and no obscure room at the far end, obscure, flock-wallpapered, with its smell of dusty floor. Everyone who passed by her seemed busy, everyone had their place in life. One who has no place in life finds it only in the wind. What memories inhabit the wind! All that is not known, the wind stores up in its memory. Established 1835. Since 1835, from father to son, the masters of this business have built up a prodigious fund of knowledge, and their clients and neighbours can dip into it. All these people know each other and exchange what they know. But the wind has gathered up the remainder, which is greater than the entire town. The wind has collected up all Angelaï¿½s thoughts. Only the wind.","series":"Visible Poets","series_num":"8","shortdesc":"","title":"33 Sonnets Of The Resistance & Other Poems","toc":"ContentsTranslatorï¿½s preface / 9Introduction / 12 33

Chaos is a particularly prominent theme in this book; in the first section, the chaos is around us, in the second, inside us, while the third and final section attempts to draw the outer and inner worlds together in order to make sense of the whole. For all its unrelenting subject matter, this is a surprisingly optimistic book ï¿½ carefully observed, sensitive and grimly witty ï¿½ and one that will confirm Joel Laneï¿½s considerable talents as a poet. ï¿½Joel Laneï¿½s world is a world of urban bleakness, and yet these beautifully written poems draw us in, tell us their stories, and in the end offer us hope. Lane is crafting work for now, for the post-industrial and brutalised twenty-first century, and this book can help us to live in that world.ï¿½Ian McMillan","collectors":"","contact":[""],"height":" 216","language":"","pages":"64","price":[{"type":"pbk","value":"7.95"},{"type":"hbk","value":"10.95"},{"type":"ebk","value":"3.99"}],"pubdate":"2004-09-01","quotes":"","review_copies":"Yorks Words (Victroia Ellis) 16.2.0517/1/05ACUMEN, Glyn PursgloveAMBIT, Martin BaxENVOI, Roger ElkinFamily Research Council, Douglas MinsonGUARDIAN (reviews), Will VenningGUARDIAN, Literary EditorINDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY, Suzi FeayINDEPENDENT, Christina PattersonLEDBURY POETRY FESTIVAL, Dr Charles BennetLONDON MAGAZINE, Sebastian BarkerIan McMillanNORTH, Peter Sansom, Janet FisherORBIS, Rupert LoydellPN REVIEW, Reviews EditorPOETRY LONDON, Pascale PettitPOETRY REVIEW, Fiona SampsonPOETRY WALES, Minhinnick, WackPOETRY QUARTERLY REVIEW, Tilla Brading, Derrick WardPRAGUE LITERARY REVIEW, Louis ArmandROUNDYHOUSE, Reviews EditorVERB, Allegra McIlroyWEYFARERS, Stella StockerWORD HOARD, Keith JafratRequested:Raw Edge Magazine 7.11.06","rights":"","sample_poem":"HeartlandIt doesnï¿½t move, but it turns.So gradually, you donï¿½t knowif itï¿½s you or the world going round.And it breathes.

At the age of thirteen, he began working at a glass factory, taking over for his father, who was blinded in a work accident. Ten years later, he arrived to the US in the early sixties and spent the decade in Greenwich Village and at the Free University studying the visual arts. He later became a Trappist monk and took a seven-year vow of silence. He has been a Catholic priest for more than two decades. In 2013, Vaso Roto, one of the Spanish-speaking world’s most prestigious presses, published his “Complete Poetry, 1983-2011”. That same year, Mujica won Spain’s coveted Casa de América Poetry Prize with Cuando todo calla.","pages":"160","price":[{"type":"pbk","value":"10.99"},{"type":"hbk","value":"13.99"},{"type":"ebk","value":"6.99"}],"pubdate":"2016-01-21","review_copies":"Standard list sent 12.1.16  pbk x 17\nAgenda (Patricia McCarthy)\nEnvoi (Jan Fortune-Wood)\nFinancial Times (Rosie Blau)\nGuardian (Claire Armitstead)\nNorth, The (Peter Sanson)\nOxford Brookes Uni (Dr Niall Munro)\nPN Review (Carcanet)\nPoetry London (Tim Dooley)\nPoetry Review (Maurice Riordan)\nIan Pople\nRoundy House (Alexandra Trowbridge-Matthews )\nStride (Rupert Lloydell)\nTears in the Fence (Ian Brinton)\nTLS (Poetry Review Editor)\nThe Times (Erica Wagner)\nTribune (Keith Richmond)\nWolf Magazine (James Byrne)\nStandard List sent 12.1.16  hbk x 3\nAcumen (Glyn Pursglove)\nIan McMillan\nWarwick Review (Michael Hulse","roleMap":[{"id":"56b1f23455bc5c8463007564","roles":{"author":false,"critic":false,"editor":false,"introducer":false,"translator":true}},{"id":"56b1f234f8a2dd1905034afe","roles":{"author":true,"editor":false,"introducer":false,"translator":false}}],"shortdesc":"Hugo Mujica is one of Argentina’s top intellectuals and a leading poet in Spanish.
