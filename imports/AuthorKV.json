His father, T. Rudhramurthy, (1927-71) known widely as 'Mahakavi', the Great Poet, was one of the leading literary figures in modern Tamil writing from Sri Lanka. Cheran grew up with a grounding in the Tamil classics, but from his early years, he also became familiar with the works of the younger, left-leaning poets who frequented their house. He graduated from Jaffna University with a degree in Biological Sciences. These were the years when ethnic conflict and civil unrest in Sri Lanka spread alarmingly. The Tamil people were outraged when Sinhala policemen set fire to the Jaffna Public Library in 1981 destroying over 95,000 books, some of them irreplaceable; but what followed, was possibly even worse. In July 1983 one of the worst pogroms against the Tamils began in Colombo and spread all over Sri Lanka. After this there were acts of violence and atrocities which were experienced daily by the Tamils.In 1984 Cheran joined the staff of the Saturday Review, an English language weekly that was known for its stand on press freedom, and fundamental rights and justice for minorities. As a poet and a political journalist, Cheran refused to align himself with any of the several Tamil militant groups that were active in Jaffna at the time. As a result he was harassed both by the Sri Lankan army and, later, by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He left for the Netherlands in 1987 where he completed a Masters degree in Development Studies. Returning to Colombo two and a half years later, he helped to start the Tamil newspaper, Sarinihar, published by the movement for Inter-Racial Justice and Equality. He was advised to leave the country yet again, in 1993. Cheran went to Toronto, Canada where he completed his Ph.D. He is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada. His academic interests focus on the study of ethnicity, identity, migration and international development. Side by side with his academic career, he has continued to write his poetry and to contribute to literary and political journals.Cheran's early poems, 1975-2000 were collected under the title Nii ippozhudhu irangum aaru (The River into which you now descend) Nagercoil, Kalcchuvadu, 2000. This was followed by Miindum kadalukku (Once again the sea) Nagercoil, Kalachuvadu, 2004 and Kaadaatru (Forest-healing) Nagercoil, Kalachuvadu, 2011. Besides this, he co-edited, along with three others, a landmark anthology of Tamil political poetry, Maranatthul vaazhvoom (We will live amidst death) Coimbatore, Vidiyal, 1985. Some of his most recent academic publications include The Sixth Genre: Memory, History and the Tamil Diaspora Imagination, Colombo, Marga Institute, 2001; History and the Imagination: Tamil Culture in the Global Context, co-edited with Darshan Ambalavanar and Chelva Kanaganayakam, Toronto, TSAR publications, 2oo7; New Demarcations: Essays in Tamil Studies, co-edited with Darshan Ambalavanar and chelva Kanaganayakam, Toronto, Canadian Scholars' Press, 2008 and Pathways of Dissent: Tamil Nationalism in Sri Lanka (ed.) New Delhi, Sage, 2009.Lakshmi Holmstrom (translsator)Lakshmi Holmstr�m is a writer and translator. She has translated short stories, novels and poetry by the major contemporary writers in Tamil.

At first a vehicle for small publications by Ian Hamilton Finlay, Cid Corman, Jonathan Williams and others, it soon developed into a means of formal investigation within his own poetry, treating the book as imaginative space, the page as a framing device or as quiet around an image or a phrase, the turning of pages as revelation or delay.From 1986, Laurie and Thomas A Clark have run Cairn Gallery, one of the earliest of �artist-run spaces�, specialising in Land Art, Minimalism and a lyrical or poetic Conceptualism. After many years in the Cotswolds, the Clarks moved in 2002 to re-open the gallery in a small fishing village in Fife in Scotland.In addition to his books and smaller publications, Clark has also made site-specific installations in galleries, in gardens or in the landscape, and has many works in permanent collections world-wide.","name":"Clark, Thomas A","nationality":"British [Scottish]","_acl":{"creator":"kid_-JQI4lwBpe"},"_kmd":{"lmt":"2016-02-03T12:27:32.552Z","ect":"2016-02-03T12:27:32.552Z"}},{"_id":"56b1f2345fd2d114270217fd","name":"Crossley-Holland, Kevin","_acl":{"creator":"kid_-JQI4lwBpe"},"_kmd":{"lmt":"2016-02-03T12:27:32.570Z","ect":"2016-02-03T12:27:32.570Z"}},{"_id":"56b1f2346d122cf36f00e722","author_address":"Confidential address:7 Ensign Dale CourtYork 6302Western Australia","biog":"John Kinsella was born in Perth, Western Australia.

In Moscow, he became involved in the activities of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (the Bolsheviks) and was imprisoned on three occasion for subversive political activities, although he avoided transportation because he was so young. In 1911, he joined the Moscow Art School where he became acquainted with members of the Russian Futurist movement � it was in the Futurist publication, 'A Slap in the Face of Public Taste' (1912), that his first poems were published � although he was expelled from the Art School in 1914 because of his political activities. His reputation as a poet, both in Russia and abroad, was established in the period leading up to the Russian Revolution, with his first major poem, 'A Cloud in Trousers', appearing in 1915, the same year in which he fell in love with his publisher�s wife, Lily Brik. Rejected as a volunteer at the beginning of the First World War, Mayakovsky worked at the Petrograd Military Automobile School as a draughtsman, and was in Petrograd to witness the October Revolution. Moving back to Moscow, he worked for the Russian State Telegraph Agency (ROSTA), creating satirical Agitprop posters, and in 1919, he published his first full collection, Collected Works 1909-1919. Mayakovsky�s popularity grew rapidly, both at home and abroad and, as one of the few Soviet writers allowed to travel freely, he visited Latvia, Britain, Germany, the USA, Mexico and Cuba, as well as travelling extensively in the Soviet Union itself. His influence on perceptions of poetry in early 20th century culture is hard to over-estimate. Towards the end of the 1920s, Mayakovsky became increasingly disillusioned with Stalin�s leadership of the Soviet Union, as his satirical plays 'The Bedbug' (1929) and 'The Bathhouse' (1930) attest, and in April 1930, he shot himself.George Hyde was born in Scotland in 1941, son of an Army officer, and read English at Cambridge under the direction of F. R. Leavis, whose work on Tolstoy inspired him to learn Russian. Graduate work at Essex University with Donald Davie, who designed pioneering courses in comparative literature and literary translation, led to a teaching post at the University of East Anglia, where he helped Max Sebald set up the British Centre for Literary Translation. This was followed by a professorship at Kyoto Women�s University, Japan, where he introduced comparative literature and culture courses. George Hyde also taught for four years at Polish universities in British Council funded posts during and after the communist period, and developed an interest in Polish theatre. Publications include a study of the Russian heritage of Vladimir Nabokov, two books on D. H. Lawrence, and literary translation from Russian and Polish, as well as numerous essays in the field of Modernism. While in Japan, George Hyde published a number of essays on the neglected Norwich writer George Borrow, which will form the basis of a monograph. In retirement, he is learning Greek and Japanese and has taken up the saxophone, and spends as much time as possible in his flat in Hania, Crete.Larisa Molotova-Koroleva (pen-name Larisa Gureyeva) was born in May 1950 in Moscow, the granddaughter of Vyacheslav M. Molotov-Skryabin, Prime Minister of the Soviet Union from 1930-1939, then Foreign Secretary from 1939-1949 and 1953-1956. She began studying English at the age of eight, and graduated in English Philology and Literature at Moscow State University, before writing a postgraduate dissertation on Jane Austen and Iris Murdoch. Her published work includes poetry ('The Stone Garden', Moscow, 2001) and numerous translations of poetry, fiction, history and memoires. Her translation of 'Love Story' (Moscow, 1990) went through three editions. At the time of publication, she is involved in a new publishing project, 'Dolinskaya Storona', which deals with the history of Vyatka (formerly Kirov), the Russian region close to the Urals. She is specialising in research on several dynasties of 18th and 19th century merchant families there. Since 1979 she has been a member of the Moscow Writers� Committee, and she has been vice-chairperson of its poetry section since 1994.

Drawn by the ambition to become a poet, he left school at the age of 17. In 1950 at 21, he was a co-founder of the literary journal Braak, and a year later, in 1951, his debut volume Vogels vliegen toch [Birds fly, don�t they?] was published. Campert is associated with the group of post-war Dutch poets known as the �Fifties Movement�. Coming to adulthood under the shadow of the Nazi occupation, these poets felt the need for a poetry that took nothing for granted, in terms of form or content. They dismantled traditional notions of poetry in favour of experiment and a language closer to common speech. Of this group Campert was the most accessible and his work has always appealed to a broad public. Remco Campert has lived by the pen, writing novellas as well as poetry, and producing mischievous columns for the Dutch daily, De Volkskrant. He has won many awards, including the most famous, the P. C. Hooft Prize, for his complete poetic oeuvre (1979). He is well-known in Holland for his readings of his poetry. He is resident in Amsterdam but has spent periods of his life in Paris and Antwerp. He is married to the art consultant, Deborah Wolf. Now in his seventies, Campert continues to write both poetry and fiction. His most recent works are the novellas, Een liefde in Parijs [A romance in Paris] (2004) and Het satijnen hart [Heart of satin], (2006). Xandra Schutte writing in the Dutch weekly Vrij Nederland, says about Campert: �His great gift is that he writes largely about himself, but does so with so great a distance that it never feels like navel-gazing and so little that he never falls into facile irony. If you want to describe his tone, however, you are chasing a soap bubble.�Donald Gardner, born in London in 1938, is a poet and freelance Dutch translator. He has lived in Holland since 1979. He was originally a translator of Latin American literature and his published work includes an acclaimed translation of Octavio Paz�s long poem, The Sun Stone (Cosmos, York 1968), and Marcel Duchamp or the Castle of Purity (Cape Goliard, 1969), also by Paz. He also published translations of poems by Ernesto Cardenal and contributed to Con Cuba, an anthology of Cuban poetry (Cape Goliard, 1969). He translated the notoriously difficult novel Three Trapped Tigers by Guillermo Cabrera Infante, in collaboration with the author (Harper & Row, 1971). He is the author of several collections of poetry, the most recent of which are: How to Get the Most out of Your Jet Lag (Ye Olde Font Shoppe, New Haven, 2001) and The Glittering Sea (Hearing Eye, 2006).

Interested in becoming an engineer, he enrolled at the Politecnico in Rome, also studying Latin and Greek at the University there but did not complete his studies. He obtained a position with the Italian government�s civil engineering corps, and in 1930, saw the publication of three poems in the avant-garde magazine 'Solaria', and then his first full-length collection, 'Acque e terre' (Waters and Lands). Two years later, his second collection, '�boe sommerso' (Sunken Oboe) appeared. In 1938, he left his government position and became editor of the weekly magazine, 'Tempo'; three years later was appointed to the Chair of Italian Literature at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan. An outspoken anti-Fascist during the Second World War, and for a while a member of the Communist Party, he published three collections during the 1940s: 'Nuove Poesie' (New Poems), 1942; 'Giorno dopogiorno' (Day after Day), 1946, and  'La vita non � sogno' (Life Is Not a Dream), 1949. He also became known as a translator � of the Greek and Roman lyric and epic poets (Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, Ovid and Virgil among them), Shakespeare, Moli�re and twentieth-century writers such as Neruda and e.e. cummings.  Quasimodo was awarded the Etna-Taormina International Prize in Poetry along with Dylan Thomas in 1953 and, in 1959,  the Nobel Prize for literature � �for his lyrical poetry, which with classical fire expresses the tragic experience of life in our own times�. His last book of verse was 'Dare e avere' (To Give and To Have), 1966. Quasimodo died in Naples on 14 June 1968.Marco Sonzogni was born in Mortara, Italy, in 1971. He holds degrees from the University of Pavia, Almo Collegio Borro-meo; the National University of Ireland, Dublin; the University of Dublin, Trinity College and Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, where he is a Lecturer in Italian.

During his student years he worked as proof-reader for the Literary Weekly and as a member of the founding editorial board of the monthly Science and Technology, editing the Life Sciences and Medical sections. From 1965 to 1970 he was editor of the poetry and prose section of the Literary Weekly. From 1970 to 1975 he worked as senior adviser at the Committee for Cultural Relations with the Diaspora. From 1975 to 1990 he worked as Secretary of the Central Committee for Armenia's State Prizes. In 1989 he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission for the Earthquake Struck Disaster Area. In 1994 he became the first elected president of the Writers' Union of Armenia. From 1999 to 2003 he served as Adviser (on cultural and educational issues) to the President of the Republic of Armenia.

He was witness to the great political and cultural revolutions in Europe in the first quarter of the twentieth century, and in the case of the radical new art emerging in Paris before the first world war was involved in reviewing exhibitions and writing articles about the new artists, as well as developing his own increasingly individual and virtuoso verse. He was secretary to the sculptor Rodin for two years, met Picasso and Tolstoy and many other giants of the artistic and intellectual community of the time, while also developing an increasingly devoted readership for his own work. He lived a semi-nomadic but genteel life, moving round Europe from hotel to borrowed rooms, from affair to aristocratic benefactor, always prioritising the promptings of his art over the demands of commitment to the conventions of bourgeois relationships. His awareness of his own calling as a poet, his immersing of himself in the role to the extent he did - as well as his controversial deliberations on love, sex, art and religious observation in both poetry and prose - resulted in a guru-like status and following in some quarters. The Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva's remarked in a letter to him that he is \"not a poet, but the very embodiment of poetry\".Today his reputation is equally as high. His Duino Elegies, completed in the same year as the Waste Land was published, are landmark expressions of the complexities of intellect and feeling a human life can experience. The Sonnets to Orpheus, written at the same time, read like exhalations after the great in-drawing of breath the Elegies demanded; delicate, thankful, ecstatic. The earlier two volumes of New Poems sound a new note in European poetry with their mix of sensual, observed scrutiny of Things, and their capturing of the inner essence of what is being observed. There are over four hundred poems written in French in the last years of his life, and hundreds more exploratory and far-reaching poems Rilke did not publish. Together with his volumes of letters, in which he himself said much of his creativity was expressed, and his extraordinary impressionistic novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, Rilke's poetry constitutes one of the great literary achievements of any century.IAN CROCKATT lives with his ceramic artist wife Wenna on a small croft in the North East of Scotland, close to gannet-crowded sea cliffs and under the flight-path of seasonally migrating geese. After many years employment as a social worker with children and families, he is working on a PhD thesis at Aberdeen University, focusing on the translation of Old Norse skaldic poetry. He has published several collections of his own poetry, Including Flood Alert (Chapman Publications, 1996), Original Myths (Cruachan Publications, 1999), The Crucifixion Bird (Northwords Folios, 2002), Blizzards of the Inner Eye (Peterloo Press, 2003), The Lyrical Beast (Salix Publications, 2004), and Skald - Viking poems (Koo Press, Aberdeen, 2009, reprinted 2011). Original Myths, which includes etchings by the Scottish artist Paul Fleming, was short-listed for the Saltire Society's Scottish Book of the Year Award in 2000. He has been a prize winner in a number of national literary competitions, and was awarded Writer's Bursaries by the Scottish Arts Council in 2004 and 2008. He is currently preparing a collection of poems translated from the work of Rognvaldr Kali Kolsson, a twelfth-century Earl of Orkney, as well as working on a new collection of his own verse.","name":"Rilke, Rainer Maria","nationality":"","_acl":{"creator":"kid_-JQI4lwBpe"},"_kmd":{"lmt":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.466Z","ect":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.466Z"}},{"_id":"56b1f2352069ed9b66005ba9","author_address":"","biog":"","name":"Matthews, Paul","nationality":"","_acl":{"creator":"kid_-JQI4lwBpe"},"_kmd":{"lmt":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.474Z","ect":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.474Z"}},{"_id":"56b1f2356d122cf36f00e729","author_address":"","biog":"","name":"Brecht, Bertold","nationality":"","_acl":{"creator":"kid_-JQI4lwBpe"},"_kmd":{"lmt":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.476Z","ect":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.476Z"}},{"_id":"56b1f235ba8593c46400be43","author_address":"7 Moyclare Park, Baldoyle, Dublin 13.

Towards the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), his family moved to France where he spent three years, partly under the German Occupation. Although he had written surrealist poems in French (and corresponded with Satre) before the age of 20, he did not start writing poetry seriously until his mid-30s. Prior to that, in the 1940s, he worked for a couple of years in the family business and then went to university to study mathematics. Most of his poetry was written between 1957 and 1963, and a volume of collected poems was published in 1968. In the last few years of his life, he turned to the study of linguistics, a subject which he taught with great success at the new Autonomous University of Barcelona. He committed suicide in 1972, shortly before his fiftieth birthday. Arthur Terry was born in York in 1927, read modern languages at Cambridge and taught Spanish at Queen�s University, Belfast before moving to the University of Essex in 1973 as Professor Literature. His interest in the Catalan language and its literature went back to his Cambridge days and, as a young postgraduate, he made his first visit to Barcelona where, in the darkest days of Francoist repression of Catalan culture, he did the groundwork for his first book and also befriended many important Catalan writers and artists with whom he remained in touch. An expert on Catalan literary history and major Catalan authors (a distinction for which he received several institutional awards �for his work as a critic and historian of Catalan literature and for services to Catalan culture�), he was also particularly renowned for his work on the Spanish poets of the seventeenth century, publishing a celebrated two-part anthology of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish poetry (1965, 1968) the introduction of which is still recognised as one of the best surveys of Spanish poetry of this period.  Arthur Terry was a devoted champion of comparative Literature, and served for several years as President of the British Comparative Literature Association, taking a particular interest in literary translation. The undisputed doyen of Catalan literary studies in the UK, he enjoyed an international reputation for his scholarship and knowledge. His sudden death, on 24 January 2004 at the age of 76, was headline news in Barcelona, where he was a much-honoured and revered figure. Seamus Heaney was born in 1939 in County Derry in Northern Ireland. He grew up in the country on a farm, attending boarding school, and later Queen�s University, Belfast, where he obtained a first class degree in English Language and Literature in 1961. From 1961 to 1972, he taught in the English Department at Queen�s University and, as a member of a poetry group run by Philip Hobsbaum, got to know Arthur Terry, then Professor of Hispanic Studies, who introduced him and his fellow writers to the work of Gabriel Ferrater. In 1972, Seamus Heaney stopped teaching in order to devote more time to his writing and for three years worked as a freelance writer, but in 1975 he resumed his teaching � at Carysfort College, Dublin and later Oxford University and Harvard University, where he is currently the Ralph Waldo Emerson Poet-in-Residence. He has published a number of poetry collections, including The Haw Lantern which won the Whitbread Poetry Award in 1987, and is also highly regarded as a translator, his translation of Beowulf (1999) winning the Whitbread Book of the Year prize. In October 1995, Seamus Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.","name":"Ferrater, Gabriel","nationality":"Spanish","_acl":{"creator":"kid_-JQI4lwBpe"},"_kmd":{"lmt":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.816Z","ect":"2016-02-03T12:27:33.816Z"}},{"_id":"56b1f2352069ed9b66005bac","author_address":"1.

He has had two novels published - 'Maddocks' (Gomer Press, 1998) and 'The Rub' (Starborn Books, 2001) - and a collection of poems, 'White' (Starborn Books, 2001), and his poems and short stories have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies. As well as being a writer, he is also a composer, and has written the music for two musicals as well as publishing several books of verse and music for educational use. Peter Oram was born in Cardiff, has lived in London, in Spain and, for many years in Pembrokeshire, but moved to Southern Germany in 2001.Authors included in Anthology + biogs:BELLA AKHMADULINA (b. 1937) reflects the new movement towards a personal poetic expression and a new lyricism that finaly became possible little by little in the so-called �thaw� that followed Stalin�s death. The influence of the Acmeist poets, and especially of Akhmatowa, is apparent in much of her work, which is clear and precise in form and imagery, often dealing with personal encounters or connections, or with everyday objects such as a motor-scooter or a gramophone. She was married first to Yevtushenko, and later to the novelist Nagibin.ANNA AKHMATOVA (1889-1966) is one of the great poets of the twentieth century and her work is known the world over. In her verse a classical purity and simplicity of form together with a clear, accurate vision are a vessel for profoundly felt emotions � in particular those associated with love, loss and suffering. She was married to Gumilev from 1910 to 1918, and the two of them, together with Mandelstam, formed the core of the Acmeist movement. At a time when many other writers went into exile, she chose to stay, and suffered accordingly. She saw many of those close to her executed (including Gumilev) or incarcerated (including her only son), while others committedsuicide or died in appalling circumstances (Mayakovsky, Mandelstam). Furthermore she saw her own work increasingly mocked and belittled, until finally she was expelled from the Writers� Union. Her poems are mostly small in scale, typically 12 or 16 lines, though later in her life she turned to longer forms, notably in the Requiem and Poem Without a Hero.INNOKENTY ANNENSKY (1856-1909), poet and extensive translator (including works by Euripides, Heine, Baudelaire, Verlaine and Rimbaud), was director of the Gymnasium in Tsarsky Selo, at which the young Akhmatova was a pupil, as was also her husband-to-be and fellow pupil Gumilev. His poetry was seen by the Acmeists as a step away from Symbolism and towards their own ideals.ALEXANDER BLOK (1880-1921) is considered to be the greatest of the Russian Symbolist poets. His earlier poems dealt with love as a mystical process, and an unattainable ideal referred to as the �Beautiful Lady�, but the ethereally lit atmosphere of these verses soon gave way to a much darker kind of imagery, full of emotional power and almost apocalyptic vision. As the Revolution approached he heralded it, notably in his most famous poem The Twelve, as a unique chance for a spiritual rebirth in Russia, but great disillusion was to follow, and he died in 1921, having written little in his last years. He was greatly revered and respected by both his contemporaries and the ensuing generations of poets, as the numerous poems to him in this book show.JOSEPH BRODSKY (1940 - 1996) left school at 15 and for seven years worked in factories and various other short-term jobs, while continuing to educate himself. His first poetic ventures were too outspoken for the Soviet authorities and after a notorious secret trial in 1964 he was convicted of �parasitism� and sentenced to five years hard labour in the village of Norinskaya in the Arkhangelsk region. Fortunately this was reduced to one and a half years after an angry protest by Jean-Paul Sartre. In 1972 he was forced to leave the Soviet Union. He settled eventually in the USA, and much of his later work was written in English. No further work of Brodsky�s appeared in Russia till 1987, when the journal ����� ��� (Novy Mir) published a selection of his poems.NIKOLAI GUMILEV (1880-1921) was one of the founders of the Acmeist group, and probably the most gifted poet of that movement after Akhmatowa and Mandelstam. He studied in Petersburg and Paris, and travelled widely during his rather brief adult life, notably in Somalia and Ethiopia. He was a soldier in the First World War, and was decorated for bravery. With the end of the war came also his divorce from Akhmatowa. He had married her 1910 when she was barely out of her teens,but almost from the beginnng they had begun to drift apart. He returned to live in Russia in 1918, but three years later he was arrested on suspicion of treason and shot.The poetry of ALEXANDER KUSHNER (b. 1936), like that of Akhmadulina, signalled the return to a more intimate and personal mode of expression and subject matter in the post-Stalin years, and Brodsky considered him one of Russia�s best twentieth-century lyric poets. Writing out of an urban context, he retains a classical attitude to form and is close in many ways to the Acmeists, as if taking up the pen where they left off. In 1999 Kushner was awarded the Pushkin Prize.OSIP MANDELSTAM (1892-1938) is considered by many to be one of the greatest Russian poets of the last century, and by some, such as the poet Paul Celan, to be one of the greatest poets of all. He too was one of the Acmeists. His three volumes of poetry � Stone, Tristia, and Poems  � reveal a strong connection with the works and values of Classicism (the title of his second book is also that of one of Ovid�s works), and the forms he uses are essentially traditional. Yet his work is anything but archaic, often fusing widely separated times and places in complex layers of startlingly luminous imagery, and his themes range from deep probings into the meaning and process of poetry to celebrations of such technological advances as the cinema and icecream. But in 1934 a poem ridiculing Stalin earned him exile first to the Urals and then to Voronezh. He died in a labour camp near Vladivostok in 1938.VLADIMIR MAYAKOVSKY (1893-1930) was the most gifted and outspoken of the Futurist poets. Breaking away from traditional forms, he developed a new poetic language of his own, powerfully driven by its punched-out stresses and colloquialisms, and characterised on the page by its �stepped� layout. He was fiercely political, and is best-known for his �thundering battle-calls�, as Akhmatowa terms his pro-revolution poetry. Yet as the �20s progressed and he saw the disastrous way things were going he became bitterly disillusioned, and in 1930 he shot himself. Typically, the Stalinist regime subsequently exploited his work as it suited them and he was elevated to legendary status. Beneath the brash and charismatic exterior, however, lay an acutely vulnerable individual, unlucky in loveand beset by loneliness. Yevtushenko�s poem Tenderness speaks of this side of his character.VLADIMIR NABOKOV (1899-1977) and BORIS PASTERNAK (1890-1960) are both so well-known to the public at large � if only through the scandal over Lolita and David Lean�s blockbuster film of Doctor Zhivago � that they need little introduction here. Nabokov left Russia at the onset of the Revolution, studied in Cambridge, and from 1922 till 1940 lived in Berlin. He finally settled in the United States. He is of course best known as a novelist, but also wrote a small amount of poetry. Pasternak, on the other hand, made a name for himself first and foremost as a poet, the publication a few years after the revolution of the collection My Sister Life bringing him fame equalled only by Mayakovsky. Zhivago, unpublishable in the Soviet Union, came out eventually in an Italian edition and brought him the Nobel Prize. But his prose output was relatively small, and itself strongly infused with the poetry that formed the core of his work.YEVGENY REYN (b.1935) was born in St Petersburg, and knew Akhmatova in her later years. He trained and briefly worked as a geologist, but then moved into journalism,  and also wrote film scripts and children�s books. His work has a quiet, descriptive quality, described by his close friendBrodsky, who used to refer to him as his �teacher�, as �elegiac�. Thanks to the censors, Reyn�s poetry did not appear in print in the Soviet Union until 1984, but has since become increasingly well-known both in Russia and, in recent years, also in the West, where translations have gradually appeared.IGOR SEVERYANIN (1887-1941), on the other hand, is almost unknown in the West, probably due at least in part to the difficulties the translation of his work presents. Yet in Russia he is considered an important, though controversial, figure. He was well-thought of by his gifted contemporaries, and at a gathering in Moscow in 1918 he was crowned �King of the poets�, leaving Mayakovski in second place. But he didn�t appear to reciprocate such respect, for in 1934 he published Medallions, a set of 100 sonnets dedicated to individual poets and composers, the tone of which ranges from a certain degree of respect to mockery, sarcasm and downright derision. All the examples in this book are from this collection. Tsvetaeva called him �a poet graced by God�, but his poem to her is particularly vicious, and Pasternak fares little better. Severyanin led the splinter-group known as the Ego-Futurists.ARSENY TARKOVSKY (1907-1989) was mainly known as a translator of poetry until in his mid-fifties he published his own first collection. But his work became well-known over the following two decades, above all through his son, the celebrated movie director Andrey Tarkovsky, who used recitations of Arseny�s verse in several of his films. But though a �late bloomer�, he is ranked by some as one of the finest poets of the period, with strong links to those of the earlier part of the century. Indeed, he was one of the coffin-bearers at Akhmatova�s funeral, along with Brodsky and the dead poet�s son Lev, and he spoke the final wordsover her grave.MARINA TSVETAEVA (1892-1941) is another of the great Russian poets of the first half of the century, though widespread recognition abroad has only come in more recent years, at least in part because she can be very difficult to translate effectively. Her voice is highly individual, and her work full of angular, rhythmic vigour and an almost physical feeling for sound, and liberally laced with exclamation marks and dashes. Born in Moscow, she spent much of her life in impoverished exile in Berlin, Paris and Prague. In 1939 she returned to Russia with her husband and daughter: he had been fighting on the side of the White Army in the past and was promptly arrested, while she herself was exiled to Yelabuga, where she hanged herself in 1941. Her first work was published in 1911, and she was one of the few poets of the time whose name is not associated with any particular group or movement. She had short but intense relationships � though mostly at at distance, through letters � with Pasternak, Mandelstam and Rilke.ANDREI VOZNESENSKY (b. 1933) is an almost exact contemporary of Yevtushenko, with whom he shares many characteristics. The roots of both reach back to Mayakovski�s politicallyorientated poetry, and both struggled to remain in favour with and loyal to the regime and its principles, but at the same time maintaining their right to speak out in a society where freedom of speech and expression was still much restricted. His poems often have scientific or science-based titles and themes, ranging from nuclear power stations and motorbike races to airports and casinos.SERGEI YESENIN (1895-1925) was born in a small village in Ryazan, but spent his youth in Moscow and then in St Petersburg, where Blok introduced him to the literary scene. Yet the countryside and the rural life of his childhood lie at the heart of all his work, and he has been called �the last of the peasant poets�. After a period of religious fervour and visions of a coming Utopia he turned to a life of decadence and drink, and scandalised society with his affairs, including his marriage to the dancer Isadora Duncan, eighteen years his senior. However, in spite of his wild ways � he was commonly referred to as �the hooligan� � he led a troubled inner life, which he ended 1925 when he hung himself in the �Angleterre� hotel in St Petersburg, having written a final farewell poem in his own blood. His verse is simple in form but his use of metaphor and imagery is quite striking and unusual and shows a deep understanding of language and its many levels.YEVGENY YEVTUSHENKO (b. 1933) was one of the first and probably most important of the period immediately after Stalin�s death. He burst onto the scene like a second Mayakovsky, and like Mayakovski he was a striking and powerful performer, often declaiming his works to huge gatherings. He swiftly gained, in a way that in the West is reserved for pop stars, a large following, for such freshness, energy, honesty and optimism had a great impact after years of Stalinist repression. Yet for a while he was criticised for what was seen as his support for the Soviet status quo, and writers such as Kingsley Amis accused him of condoning the invasion of Czechoslovakia and refusing to defend Pasternak in the latter�s Nobel Prize controversy. But the accusations were based mainly on newspaper gossip, and he was not afraid to speak his mind, as in his famous Babi Yar, a poem about the mass murder of Jews in the concentration camp of that name. His poetry ranges from the lyrical to the political.

On the advice of the editor, Von Ficker, the money was awarded to the Austrian Georg Trakl, whose highly expressive visionary poetry had already deeply impressed the other recipient of that award, Rainer Maria Rilke. From a precarious existence and in the space of a few years, Trakl, a veritable po�te maudit, poured forth an extraordinary and unclassifiable volume of poems replete with mesmerising imagery and haunting visions. Highly sensitive and morbidly introspective, the young poet from Salzburg took his cue from Nietzsche, Rimbaud and Dostoyevsky. Trakl�s preoccupation is the fall of mankind, a yearning for transcendence through religious purity and love in the face of overwhelming morbid despair. Incoherent symbolic images cascade in a delirious fashion to form dream-like worlds, both nightmarish and eerily beautiful. Despite numerous attempts to explain Trakl�s vision, his poetry has steadfastly defied any coherent critical analysis. Though Trakl�s vision is bleak, there is great tenderness and a sense of hope against all the odds secreted in his poetry, factors which are often overlooked in the light of his brief and irrevocably doomed existence. In November 1914, Trakl, who had enthusiastically enlisted in the Austrian army as a medical orderly, died from an overdose of cocaine whilst being held for psychiatric observation in a military hospital in Krakow, Poland. He was twenty-seven.Will Stone (translator)Will Stone was born in 1966 and lives in Suffolk. He is a poet and translator and holds an MA in Literary Translation from the University of East Anglia.

He has contributed as editor, translator, essayist and photographer to a new translation of the novel Bruges-la-Morte by Belgian symbolist poet Georges Rodenbach, published by Dedalus in 2005. Further translations of poems by Baudelaire, Nerval, Verhaeren, Rodenbach and Egon Schiele have appeared in various journals including Modern Poetry in Translation, Poetry Salzburg, Agenda, The International Review and Pretext. His reviews have appeared in the TLS,  Guardian, Independent on Sunday, The London Magazine, Poetry Review and PN Review. A number of his translations were also selected for the Tate anthology of German Expressionist poetry, Music While Drowning, in 2003, the title of which is taken from a poem by Schiele. He has published several pamphlet collections of poetry as well as an essay on poet / singer-songwriter Nick Drake.

Since then he has enjoyed life in a number of places, rural and urban, the most peaceful of which was the village of Gravenhurst in Bedfordshire, where he planted and tended an orchard garden; and the most dramatic, the small island of Rousay in Orkney, where he lived with a fellow-poet from 1996-99. He is now back in the county he started from.

The judges included A.S. Byatt, Tom Paulin and Carol Ann Duffy. 1989 saw the publication of his first full collection, A Sleep of Drowned Fathers (Peterloo), a long narrative sequence which won the Aldeburgh Poetry Festival Prize for best first collection of its year, and was described by Peter Porter as �a triumph of storytelling�. Three years later came Graffiti for Hard Hearts (Arc), a substantial book of shorter poems. In 1995, the writer was awarded a Writer�s Bursary by the Arts Council of England for �work in progress�, a characteristically dramatic collection eventually published by Arc as Othello in the Pyramid of Dreams.

She grew up in a very musical family and herself won a national prize for music at the age of 13 as the pianist in a piano trio which she formed with two of her brothers. Following her studies in Mathematics and Education, she taught at a secondary school in Feldberg and it was here that she first started to write poetry � as a form of escape, a way of expressing her longing for a different life. She subsequently studied Music and worked as a freelance music teacher and musician until, in 1984, she was appointed archivist in the Hans Fallada Archive in Feldberg. The fifteen years she spent working with the manuscripts and papers of one of Germany�s most popular twentieth-century writers proved to be a most productive period in which she began to publish her own poetry as well as essays and books on Fallada. The Fishermen Sleep, originally published in German in 1994 as Immer zu Fu�, is her first volume of poetry. She has said of her poetry: �I�m not a political poet � I�m more interested in the landscape of the soul (�Seelenlandschaft�)�. The poems in this anthology are mostly poems written in the GDR. The last one in the collection, �The Fishermen�, was awarded the Alfred Gesswein Prize in Austria. Since 1999 Sabine Lange has completed a second volume of poetry and is currently working on the publication of her diaries (1984-1999) as well as a book on the role of the GDR Ministry for State Security (�Stasi�) in the formulation of literary policy in the Fallada Archive. Jenny Williams is Associate Professor in the School of Applied Language and Intercultural Studies and a member of the Centre for Translation and Textual Studies at Dublin City University, Ireland.

A Beginner�s Guide to Doing Research in Translation Studies (Manchester: St. Jerome, 2002). This is her first volume of poetry translation.Mary O�Donnell is a poet, novelist, translator and critic who is based in Co. Kildare, Ireland.

In 1940 his family fled to England to escape the German occupation.  He learned English in a school run by Spanish Jesuits, discovered English literature, and wrote his first unpublished poems in English.  He returned to Belgium in 1948 and rediscovered his native language and literature.  His association with the irreverent, experimental group that formed around the magazine Phantomas inspired him to develop a distinctive identity as a poet inspired by art, nature, philosophy, and psychoanalysis.  His three major volumes of poetry are Les Saisons (1979), Le Domino gris (1984), and Le Livre de la neige (1990). El�ments de g�om�trie, a volume of prose poems written a few years before his death in 1992, was published in 2005.

Martin Sorrell (introducer)","biog":"MAURICE CAREME (author) was born on 12 May 1899 in Wavre, a small town in Brabant-Wallon, Belgium, where his father Joseph was a painter and decorator and his mother, Henriette Art, ran a small grocery shop cum general store. One of his grandfathers sold goods from a gypsy caravan. His elder sister, born in 1898, only lived a day, his other sister, Germaine, was born in 1901; his younger brothers, Georges and Marcel, were born in 1904 and 1907 but Marcel only lived for eight months. Maurice had a very happy country childhood, which he often brought back to life in his poems. His first ones, written in 1914, were inspired by Bertha Detry, his childhood girlfriend. In the same year he won a scholarship to a teacher training college, the Ecole Normale de Tirlemont. Julien Kuypers was the teacher who encouraged him to write and introduced him to contemporary poetry. In 1918 Careme left Wavre to become a primary school teacher in Brussels and in 1924 married Andr�e Gobron, a fellow teacher (Caprine in his poems). The Brabant-style house he had built in Avenue Nellie Melba, is where they lived from 1933. It was known as �la Maison Blanche� and became the seat of the Fondation Maurice Car�me in 1975 and the Mus�e Maurice Careme on his death in 1978. He was 78. Careme gave up teaching to write full-time in 1943. Author of some ninety books, novels, short stories, fables and essays, as well as poems, he published a collection of poems nearly every year from 1947 until 1975. 'M�re' (1935) won the Prix Triennal de Po�sie and 'La maison blanche' (1949) the Prix de l�Acad�mie Fran�aise. Where 'Chansons pour Caprine' (1930) reflected quite a painful married life, his love poems were more discreet in Femme (1946) and, when inspired by Jeannine Burny, full of youthful vigour in 'La bien-aim�e' (1965). In Paris in 1972 he was elected 'Prince des po�tes' to succeed Jean Cocteau. He won numerous other prizes in Belgium and abroad, including one for his translation of Flemish poets. Even as a very weak 78 year old, he worked till the very last minute of his final afternoon, 13 January 1978. 'D�fier le destin' appeared in 1987 and includes a selection of the poems he felt were finished. He had asked Jeannine (his friend and assistant since 1943 and now the President of the Fondation) to arrange the poems she was sure he had finished and for the cover of this collection she called on their friend, the artist Paul Delvaux. A subsequent collection, rather darker in tone, 'De plus loin que la nuit', appeared in 1992, and after a collection for the Gallimard Jeunesse series, 'L�oiseleur et autres po�mes', (2003), another, 'Et puis apr�s', in 2004, and yet another 'Etre ou ne pas �tre' in 2008.CHRISTOPHER PILLING (translator) was born in Birmingham and taught French and P.E on the Wirral, in a Quaker boarding school and a large Comprehensive in Yorkshire before moving to Keswick, Cumbria, where he taught French, German and Latin. He was a prize-winner in the National Poetry Competition and has published nine collections of his own poetry, as well as translations of poems by Tristan Corbi�re (a Book of the Year for the Sunday Telegraph and the World Service of the BBC in 1995), Max Jacob and Lucien Becker (a PBS Recommended Translation in 2004). He has also written a number of plays. With William Scammell, he founded a Cumbrian Poets� workshop which has run for thirty years, and has seen two of his plays performed at Theatre by the Lake in Keswick. In 2006, Christopher Pilling won first prize in the John Dryden Translation Competition, one of the UK�s most prestigious translation awards. MARTIN SORRELL (introducer) is Emeritus Professor of French and Literary Translation at the University of Exeter. He has published extensively. Among his books are 'Elles: A Bilingual Anthology of French Poetry by Women' (1995) and, in Oxford University Press�s �World Classics� series, 'Paul Verlaine: Selected Poems' (1999), 'Arthur Rimbaud: Collected Poems' (2001) and 'Frederico Garcia Lorca: Selected Poems' (2007).
